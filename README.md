## DATA SCIENCE SKILLS THAT MATTER

Our group embarked on the quest to find an answer to the title question. Our approach consisted of trying to identify the terms that are commonly tagged along with the Twitter handle #Datascience. This provides the keywords that are most often associated with ‘data science’. The top 20 de-duped keywords will serve as a dictionary for the analysis. It is important to note that, these keywords may not be used in professional job listings. To validate the findings from Twitter, professional job listing sites in the US such as LinkedIn and Indeed will be used.
